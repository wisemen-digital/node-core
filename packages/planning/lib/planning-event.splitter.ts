 * Open events are split
 *  1. Date splitting: by date range
 *      [ |  | ]  =>  [head][overlap][tail]
 *  2. Periodically: only overlapping periods are considered
 *     Open event          X  X  X  X  X  X
 *     Overlapping event   Y     Y     Y
 *     Split open events   A  B  A  B  A  B
 *  3. Time splitting: Timeslots are intersected to split the event
 *      [ |  | ]  =>  [head][overlap][tail]
